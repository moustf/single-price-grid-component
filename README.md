This challenge is one of the Frontend mentor platfrom.

## ♢ You can check the page o ut from [Here](https://moustf.github.io/single-price-grid-component/)

## ♢ User stories: 

The users should be able to:
. View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
. See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## ♢ User journey:

- When the user first opens the price component, he/she will find a top section with promotion content,
an then at the bottom section, he/she will find two parts:
* The first part is about the subscription information.
* The second part is about why choosing this company.

## ♢ Technologies that I used:

- HTML5.
